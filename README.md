# RunCadetRun

Hi!! This project is a game designed and developed by me and two of my colleagues from <Academia de Código_>, Hugo Silveira and Frederico Gonçalves.
<span>For this project we had one week to develop it in Java with a [simple graphics library](https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics) provided by Academia, <strong>when we were only on our 4th bootcamp week, with none of us having prior experience.</strong>

## Menus
  
The first interaction with the game is self explanatory by a series of introductory menus, although it isn't possible to navigate between them after you advance.

## Concept
  
Our approach was to build a pacman like game with our bootcamp experience as you can read in the image above, at the start we thought we could build a maze and have the game play around it but as time was short for us, unexperienced students, we settled our MVP by doing it on a open field and if we had the time by end, we would try to implement that.
The user can choose from a pool of 12 code cadets, us developers included.

## Game Play
  
The game starts and the player appears in the middle of the field, with one MC appearing in a random location in the field, at the same time 5 objects also appear randomly through it.
As you catch the objects your score rises, and the MC moves towards you, if she catches you, you lose a life, which you only have 3.

As your score increases, more MC's appear to a maximum of 3 and their speed rise, the 2nd MC spawns when your score is higher than 10k and the 3rd when it reaches 20k.
When your score surpasses 25k all the objects disappear and the last one spawns, and if you are able to catch it you win, which is a reference to our "graduation".

To exit the game you have to hard close it, by typing "control + C" on the console (sorry but the lack of experience is noticeable :)).  
  
## Conclusion
Our main goal was also to give to each one of our colleagues from the bootcamp something to remember our class by, doing it in a fun way.
We were proud of the finished project since it was the first real project by ourselves, but we were also feeling that we could've done much better.
