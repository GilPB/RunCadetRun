# RunCadetRun

Hi!! This project is a game designed and developed by me and two of my colleagues from <Academia de CÃ³digo_>, Hugo Silveira and Gil Pinto Basto.
For this project we had one week to develop in Java with a simple graphics library provided by Academia, when we were only on our 4th bootcamp week, with none of us having prior experience.
We were proud of the finished project since it was the first real project by ourselves, but we were also feeling that we could've done much better.

The instructions are provided in game, but to exit the game you have to hard close it, by typing ^C on the console(sorry but the lack of experience is noticeable :)).
